THEORY
Circuit that takes the logical decision and the process are called logic gates. Each gate has one or more input and only one output.
OR, AND & NOT are basic gates. NAND, NOR are known as universal gates. Basic gates can be formed from these gates. XOR & XNOR are derived gates.

AND GATE

The AND gate performs a logical multiplication commonly known as AND function. The output is high when both the inputs are high. The output is low level when any one of the inputs is low.

OR GATE
The OR gate performs a logical addition commonly known as OR function. The output is high when any one of the inputs is high. The output is low level when both the inputs are low.
 
NOT GATE
The NOT gate is called an inverter. The output is high when the input is low. The output is low when the input is high.

NAND GATE
The NAND gate is a contraction of AND-NOT. The output is high when both inputs are low and any one of the inputs is low.The output is low level when both inputs are high.

NOR GATE
The NOR gate is a contraction of OR-NOT. The output is high when both inputs are low. The output is low when one or both inputs are high.

X- OR GATE
The output is high when any one of the inputs is high. The output is low when both the inputs are low and both the inputs are high.
